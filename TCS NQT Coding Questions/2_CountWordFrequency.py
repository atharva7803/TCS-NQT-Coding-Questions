write a function countFrequency(s) that takes a string s as input and returns the frequency of each character in the string as a dictionary.

If the input contains any digits or numbers, return "Invalid input".

Example 1: apple banana orange apple

Output: apple 2 banana 1 orange 1

Example 2: apple 10 banana orange
